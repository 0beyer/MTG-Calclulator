# MTG Calculator
This is a fun little calculator to calculate the odds of drawing things in mtg. To use it, upload a file, with each line of the form
int; string-1, string-2, ..., string-n
then change what commands are run!
Its a little klunky to use right now, but ill implement it as a webapp at some point.
